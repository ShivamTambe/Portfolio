                Challenges
            </h1>
            <p>
                One of the major challenges was ensuring that the website looked great on all devices, from large
                desktop monitors to small mobile screens. I had to carefully craft the layout using flexbox and CSS grid
                to make sure the design was flexible. A lot of time was spent testing across different screen sizes and
                devices to ensure consistency and responsiveness. I also used media queries to adjust specific
                components like the navigation bar and images for smaller screens, improving the user experience across
                all devices.

                By utilizing responsive design principles, the E-State website now offers a smooth and consistent
                experience across all devices. Whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, users can easily
                navigate the website, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. The website's flexibility and
                adaptability have contributed to a significant increase in mobile users and improved overall user
                retention.
